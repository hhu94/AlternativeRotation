# Features

This module adds a new way of rotating tiles and tokens: shift+dragging towards the intended direction. This is in 
addition to the default methods of rotation a token in Foundry - shift+scrolling while hovering over it, and shift+arrows
when selecting it. 

Hold the Shift key and drag with the left mouse button away from a token. The token will rotate to face the cursor, 
settling when you let go of the mouse button.

By holding Shift+Ctrl, rotation will snap to the grid directions (same directions you'd snap to when doing the default 
"fast rotation" in Foundry; 45° or 60°). With Shift only, rotation will snap to 5 degrees, though you can completely
disable even this snapping in the settings ("Smooth rotation").

Rotation will assume that the bottom of the token image is its "front"; the token looks down when viewing its image.
This is the most common standard for token images.
